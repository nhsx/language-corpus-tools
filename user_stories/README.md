## A collection of user stories

Written in the format: 

As a **< type of user >**, I want **< some goal >**, so that **< some reason >**

- As an Annotator, I want to be able to annotate free text documents using appropriate coding (e.g. SNOMED-CT, ICD-10, dm+d, etc.), so that I can enrich the text for downstream tasks

- As an Annotator, I want to be able to annotate at various levels (cross-document, document, sentence, term), so that I can enrich the free text for downstream tasks
		
- As an Engineer, I want to be able to deploy the set up easily and ‘switch it off’ but keep necessary artefacts intact when the set up is not in use, so that I can keep costs down (in the cloud)

- As an Engineer/Data Scientist, I want to be able to customise the annotation set up to perform different types of annotation (e.g. temporal, coding, negation), so that I help annotators enrich the free text for downstream tasks
		
- As a Data Scientist, I want to be able to ingest different sources of free text data, so that I can extend the language corpus for end-users

- As a Data Scientist, I want to be able to integrate different NLP approaches or engines into the pipeline, so that I can compare across different techniques

- As a Data Scientist, I want to be able to use automatic annotation and feed this to annotators for checking, so that I can make the task of annotation more efficient

- As a Data Scientist, I want to be able to explore the different data sources we have ingested and their annotations, so that I can understand more about the corpus and look at different future uses
		
- As an End User of the Corpus, I want to be able to see the set up used and potentially customise, so that I can use it for my own tasks

- As an End User of the Corpus, I want to be able to identify versions of the dataset, so that I can use it for my own NLP tasks and audit document changes in it over time

- As an End User of the Corpus, I want to be able to get access to the underlying free text in the dataset in a useful format, so that I can use it for my own NLP tasks

- As an End User of the Corpus, I want to be able to get access to the enrichment metadata in a suitable format, so that I can use it for my own NLP tasks
